# Gesture-Control-Volume-Control
## Hand Volume Control - Python Project

**Control volume with hand gestures!** âœ‹ This Python project utilizes MediaPipe to track your hand and adjust system volume based on finger distance. A volume bar and indicator provide real-time feedback.

**Features:**

- **Intuitive Control:** Pinch your thumb and index finger to adjust volume smoothly.
- **Visual Feedback:** A clear volume bar and percentage indicator keep you informed.
- **Pinky Finger Lock:** Prevents unintentional changes by requiring your pinky to be down.

**How it Works:**

1. **Hand Detection:** MediaPipe tracks your hand in real-time using your webcam.
2. **Landmark Extraction:** Identifies key points on your hand (fingertips).
3. **Distance Calculation:** Calculates the distance between your thumb and index finger.
4. **Volume Mapping:** Maps the distance to a corresponding volume level (0-100%).
5. **Volume Adjustment:** Uses Pycaw to adjust system volume based on the calculated level.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- pycaw
- Hand Tracking Module (replace with custom module or public link)

**Usage:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw` (assuming `handtrackingmodule` is already installed).
3. Run the main script (`hand_volume_control.py` or equivalent).
4. Open your webcam and control volume with hand gestures!

**Additional Notes:**

This is a starting point. Consider customizing volume control behavior, adding visual effects, or integrating with different audio sources. Explore error handling and user feedback for a more robust experience.
